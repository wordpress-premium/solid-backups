	RE CHRIS NOTES:
		The backup file listing shows a lot of "Unknown" strings. Considering that some of the listings have seven unknowns, the information becomes muddled and difficult to read.
			Unknown should only be displayed for old backups (hopefully). Any suggestions on cleaning this up for backups that lack this data?
		PclZip issue
			Unable to replicate.
			This error is thrown here.  From your log this means that fopen must have returned a false for some reason for you.
				1953 if (($this->zip_fd = @fopen($this->zipname, $p_mode)) == 0)
				1954 {
				1955   // ----- Error log
				1956   PclZip::privErrorLog(PCLZIP_ERR_READ_OPEN_FAIL, 'Unable to open archive \''.$this->zipname.'\' in '.$p_mode.' mode');
				1957
				1958   // ----- Return
				1959   //--(MAGIC-PclTrace)--//PclTraceFctEnd(__FILE__, __LINE__, PclZip::errorCode(), PclZip::errorInfo());
				1960   return PclZip::errorCode();
				1961 } 
		After adding a destination, it appears that the only thing that happens is that the inputs empty. I have to scroll to the top of the dialog to see that something has actually happened. The same thing happens when modifying an existing destination except that the inputs do not clear out after submission. If the submission is to be handled by Javascript and not a fresh page load, then the page should be automatically scrolled to the top so that it is clear that the action did something.
			Unable to replicate. Forms submit without javascript and the action goes back to the same page with an anchor to the same tab so it should be going to the top.
		When selecting an existing remote destination, what if I want to use a different path? An option should allow for customizing the path without requiring modification of the remote destination (if the destination is used for backups and the user forgets to change it back after the migration, then their new site will start to fill with backups). The feature should support supplying new FTP information without creating a new destination.
			The entire remote destination system needs refactored and really needs to be done to make this doable without severe rigging.
			As a workaround I've added the ability to duplicate destinations for now until the destination system is redone.
		Backup listing actions inconsistent. For example clicking the backup filename on the migration page shouild start migration instead of downloading the archive. @see Chris' suggestions for handling this. - re: Chris

		Re-evaluate how this currently works to implement this. This would be helpful for guiding users.
	Capitalization in S3 bucket names seem to be ignored when copying. Not sure why this would happen yet. - re: Chris

		If sending to remote destination and the file already exists then don't overwrite without confirmation. @see Chris suggestions on handling this. - re: Chris

		Works great combined with the Note feature.

	FEATURE: Individual files can now be excluded from backups (no longer just directories!). Now listing files in exclusions navigator for easier exclusion of individual files.
		A few giant files clogging up your backups? Not only can you exclude entire directories but now you can also exclude individual files!

	mysqlbuddy updated to provide error message when mysql_query() returns false.
	Upgraded Amazon S3 library to 0.5.0.
	Added ImportBuddy favicon.
	FEATURE: Added Amazon S3 support for "Reduced Redundancy" class storage for a more affordable cloud storage option.

This can be accessed on the Server Information page by hovering over a table name in the list. This is a simple way to check and perform a basic repair.
	ImportBuddy upload feature no longer redirects back to login screen.

		Backups are organized within their own site folder for easy access.
		Manage your backups, delete, copy down to local, or get a direct download link good for an hour.
	FEATURE: PHP Max Execution time tester added (beta)
		Allows you to actually perform a test to determine your real tested maximum execution time allowed by your server. BackupBuddy attempts to override the execution time allowed to a very high number but almost all hosts cap the number much lower so the reported number can be far too high.  This test actually runs a script and keeps trask of the elapsed time to determine the actual maximum execution time limit of your server.
	FEATURE: Stash now supports multipart uploads (chunking uploads into pieces to allow larger files to be transferred in pieces over time).
		Extremely large files can now be transferred to Stash than could be before by breaking files up into 'chunks' and sending one piece at a time.

5.0.0.0 - 2014-08-20 - Dustin Bolton
	OVERVIEW:
		This release focuses on improving core functionality to the next level on both the backup and restore side.  Performance, robustness, and usability have all been
		improved in this release.  This means that BackupBuddy and ImportBuddy are easier to use & understand as well as better handling larger sites better, especially
		large databases.  More advanced handling of problems and various fallbacks and intelligent checks (eg to handle .htaccess AddHandler issues) help to work around
		previous issues. If something does go wrong that cannot be worked around BackupBuddy or ImportBuddy will look at the situation and give contextually appropriate
		information to help you resolve the problem without having to seek outside help or reference.  Improved persistant logging helps track processes for
		troubleshooting if support is still needed.

Upon cron.php destination_send() running, a file is created in the BB log directory named cronSend-UNIQUE_ID_HERE.lock if it does not exists with a string of 1 as the contents. If it already exists then the schedule has run more than once and the attempt will be logged with the attempt count and halted.

	FEATURE:
		BackupBuddy Stash Live
			Requires PHP v5.3 or newer. PHP v5.3 was released June 30th, 2009.
			The easiest to use, most shared hosting-friendly backup solution, without sacrificing any power. Live backup of all content, snapshots stored to Stash, and all files scanned for malware and viruses.
			Mirrors your complete site including files, database, and all WordPress content offsite to BackupBuddy Stash Live servers, keeping your backup in sync with your site.
			Live backup of WordPress database changes as they occur, including periodic full database dumps to insure nothing gets out of sync.
			Backup of all site files to Live servers, scanned regularly for changes, new, or deleted files.
			Schedule to regularly snapshot zip files of all the data stored on the BackupBuddy Stash Live servers.
			Option to manually create a snapshot of the stored data.
			Snapshotting results in a full backup zip file, database only backup zip file, a zip of the theme directory, and a zip of the plugin directory.
			Snapshots are fully BackupBuddy compliant zip files.
			Snapshots are fully scanned for malware and viruses, able to catch infections not normally found by front-end only scanners.
			Automatically requests BackupBuddy Stash Live servers 'ping' the site during Live activity to prevent delays between steps for low activity sites.
			Your latest snapshot zip file is stored for a week regardly of whether it is also set to save into Stash.
			Snapshots may be stored indefinitely in your Stash storage, limited only by your Stash quota.
			Advanced options to control additional inclusions or exclusions beyond your BackupBuddy defaults.
			Easy to use. Sign in with your iThemes login and BackupBuddy Stash Live immediately starts backing up your site.
			Incremental: only changed files are transferred, saving server resources and time.
			Regular file auditing. Not only are file transfers verified as they occur but also all files are regularly verified against the BackupBuddy Stash Live server to insure they are still properly in sync.
			Works on local development sites as long as either a) site activity exists (such as by you using the wp-admin) or b) you stay on the BackupBuddy Stash Live page to continue to push the cron along.
			New Sync verb backupbuddy-get-liveStats for retrieving local catalog/state statistics such as those shown on the BackupBuddy Stash Live page.
			Live update of stats when viewing the BackupBuddy Stash Live page.
	FEATURE:
		Stash (v2) destination now requests Stash Server to ping site whenever chunking commences to help push the cron along for inactive sites.
	FEATURE:
		Added single retry when attempting to schedule a one-time or recurring event in case there is a temporary problem.
	FEATURE:
		Only one BackupBuddy cron action may run per PHP page load. Subsequent actions will be rescheduled for the next load.
	FEATURE:
		If any maximum log file size is exceeded it is now trimmed down to 50% of its size (keeping most recent 50%) instead of completely deleting the log file.
	ENHANCEMENT:
		Adding remote destinations are now grouped by "Preferred", "Normal", and "Legacy" to make selecting destinstions easier.
	ENHANCEMENT:
		New option to limit the number of files returned in Amazon S3 (v2) destination. Defaults to 250 files per page.

	Deployment no longer sends error emails for failed remote sends.

	Added new {home_url} variable for error notification emails.
	Error emails now default to mentioning the {home_url} rather than {site_url} in emails.
	ImportBuddy: Now handles Live-formatting SQL filenames, prefixed with underscores. Imports underscore prefixed timestamped SQL files after normal SQL files, playing them back in the order they occurred.
	FEATURE:
		Automatic testing of the reported maximum PHP execution time.
			Improved reliability of traditional backups, remote destination sends, Deployments, and BackupBuddy Stash Live.
			Many servers report their maximum PHP execution time as a higher number than is actually available. This interferes with BackupBuddy's chunking during database backups, file transfers,
			and other operations which require a lot of time.  As of v7.0 BackupBuddy will actually test the available runtime and use the lesser value between the reported and tested numbers to
			ensure that chunking commences before time runs out, drastically reducing the chance of timeouts during any procedure where chunking is available and the server is misreporting runtime.
	Added additional logging when error is returned accessing remote API during deployment.

	New default log size of 3MB. Updated to new default if old value was either of the old defaults of 10mb or 5mb.

	PROFILES
		New "Smart Profiles" Themes, Plugins, Media for backing up files of each respective type/location:
			SCREENSHOT: http://image.prntscr.com/image/c866aeb96c8d47dd86d44dbd66b3274b.png
			Use the new default smart profiles or create your own for further customizing. These new profile types allow you to automatically only backup this section of the site, allowing for more granular control over what is backed up by a profile. Paired with scheduling this allows you to easily break up backup processes into smaller portions for better spreading server load or timeout issues, especially for larger sites. Smart profiles also support directory and file exclusions.
		New "Custom backup root" option for all profile types (except database):
			SCREENSHOT: http://image.prntscr.com/image/af2c0f714183423eb8b04d4c146ad1e6.png
			You can now configure which directory BackupBuddy backs up on a per-profile basis. Prior to this feature you could only backup the entire site and select directories to exclude. You can now select any directory to be backed up, even directories ABOVE the WordPress root (abspath) by using "/../" in the path. This is useful for backing up individual directories, 3rd party applications, or directories outside the WordPress root. This can also be used for more granular control when breaking up backups across multiple profiles for spreading server load or working around timeout issues.
			Global exclusions apply but default but exclusions may be set for just this profile relative to this custom path manually or with the exclusion picker.
		"Full" and "Files" profiles now have three SMART exclusion options: Auto-exclude Media Directory, Auto-exclude Themes Directory, Auto-exclude Plugins Directory for making it easier to exclude directories which can be backed up by other default Profile types.
			SCREENSHOT: http://image.prntscr.com/image/5a2b85de30ad4ab281a362630fc038c6.png
		Backup profiles can now individually override the default global backup mode (classic vs modern) on a per-profile basis.
			SCREENSHOT: http://image.prntscr.com/image/b42fdd4ff549416fa9a25be28f1643e0.png
	STASH LIVE
		Significant performance improvements, especially for larger sites. Sites which in the past would run out of memory due to hosting limits are very likely to now operate within server limits.
		A troubleshooting scan is now regularly performed detecting common problems and alerting the user and also providing solutions.
		A new "Troubleshooting Scan" button to upper right of page of Stash Live page is available for manually troubleshooting.
			SCREENSHOT: http://image.prntscr.com/image/b80166b92ce24f77986b4892150ee325.png
	IMPORTBUDDY:

			SCREENSHOT: http://image.prntscr.com/image/a10ff6ca440c4d6a8658eb3ed49c9e33.png
		Added "Forgot password" feature which allows you to generate a new password hash. This hash can then be placed inside the importbuddy.php file to make it usable even if you forgot its password.

		Improved look and feel with animated progress as well as highlights to areas that require user attention.
		importbuddy.php file size has been reduced for faster uploading during restore process.
	GENERAL
