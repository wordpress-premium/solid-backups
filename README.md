### `9.1.15` - 2024-03-24

*Contributors: Volodymyr Shelmuk*
*   **Bug Fix:** Corrected a translation loading error. Finally, the world can understand your software's mistakes in their native tongue.

### `9.1.14` - 2024-11-11

*Contributors: Timothy Jacobs, John Regan*

*   **Important:** The Google Drive destination is no longer supported. Any schedules with a Google Drive destination have had the destination removed. Read more about this exciting new feature removal [here](https://go.solidwp.com/google-drive-deprecation).
*   **Bug Fix:** Prevented conflicts with plugins like W3 Total Cache, which provide their own copy of Guzzle. Because who doesn't love a good old-fashioned dependency war?
*   **Tweak:** Renamed the plugin to `Solid Backups – Legacy`. A charming euphemism for "on its way out." Learn more about its replacement, `Solid Backups – NextGen`, [here](https://go.solidwp.com/backups-ng-get-backups-nextgen).

### `v9.1.13` - 2024-07-01

*Contributors: Jared Hill*
*   **Deprecated:** Google Drive will no longer be available as of August 1. Another one bites the dust. [Read more](https://go.solidwp.com/google-drive-deprecation).

### `v9.1.12` - 2024-04-29

*Contributors: Jared Hill, John Regan*
*   **Bug Fix:** Added additional items to StellarWP Telemetry data tracking. Now you can know even *more* about things you probably won't look at.
*   **Bug Fix:** Added graceful handling of a `passthru()` function fatal error. It now fails with elegance.
*   **Enhancement:** Added Google Drive API legal text and link. Just in time for its deprecation. Beautiful.
