		Ability to undo the database changes with one click if something goes wrong prior to confirming the deployment once you're satisfied.
		Automatic chunking of data transferred between servers to support large files or slow servers.
		Swaps databases only after the entire database and all files have been transferred to attempt to minimize site downtime to mere seconds (or less!).
		Perfect for developing your site in a different location from the live site.  Use staging best practices.
	Google Drive Destination

		Debugging backup process data only sent to browser javascript console when in development mode.
		Fileoptions storage of the backup state now clears step arguments for finished functions to prevent buildup of state data once a function has passed (eg for deployment state or new alternate zip method state) to prevent rapid uncontrolled fileoptions file growth.

		Remote destination sends that have not been updated after a period of time are now marked as timed out and send notification email.
		Old status logs will now be removed after 10 days rather than 2 days.
		Fixed "File destination send finished email recipient(s)" feature not sending notification emails.
		Fixed issue 'Manual Backup With Send and Delete After Reports ZIP File Not Found at End' by no longer wiping send_remote_destination step information from fileoptions after function finish.
		Fixed timing issue / race condition where _getBackupStatus.php retrieving fileoptions could possibly retrieve the file mid-write, resulting in an incomplete serialized array being returned and a fatal error #9031b.  If this happens then it will sleep for 1 second, up to 10 times, re-checking the fileoptions file for valid contents prior to proceeding.

	FEATURE:
		BackupBuddy Stash Live
			Requires PHP v5.3 or newer. PHP v5.3 was released June 30th, 2009.
			The easiest to use, most shared hosting-friendly backup solution, without sacrificing any power. Live backup of all content, snapshots stored to Stash, and all files scanned for malware and viruses.
			Mirrors your complete site including files, database, and all WordPress content offsite to BackupBuddy Stash Live servers, keeping your backup in sync with your site.
			Live backup of WordPress database changes as they occur, including periodic full database dumps to insure nothing gets out of sync.
			Backup of all site files to Live servers, scanned regularly for changes, new, or deleted files.
			Schedule to regularly snapshot zip files of all the data stored on the BackupBuddy Stash Live servers.
			Option to manually create a snapshot of the stored data.
			Snapshotting results in a full backup zip file, database only backup zip file, a zip of the theme directory, and a zip of the plugin directory.
			Snapshots are fully BackupBuddy compliant zip files.
			Snapshots are fully scanned for malware and viruses, able to catch infections not normally found by front-end only scanners.
			Automatically requests BackupBuddy Stash Live servers 'ping' the site during Live activity to prevent delays between steps for low activity sites.
			Your latest snapshot zip file is stored for a week regardly of whether it is also set to save into Stash.
			Snapshots may be stored indefinitely in your Stash storage, limited only by your Stash quota.
			Advanced options to control additional inclusions or exclusions beyond your BackupBuddy defaults.
			Easy to use. Sign in with your iThemes login and BackupBuddy Stash Live immediately starts backing up your site.
			Incremental: only changed files are transferred, saving server resources and time.
			Regular file auditing. Not only are file transfers verified as they occur but also all files are regularly verified against the BackupBuddy Stash Live server to insure they are still properly in sync.
			Works on local development sites as long as either a) site activity exists (such as by you using the wp-admin) or b) you stay on the BackupBuddy Stash Live page to continue to push the cron along.
			New Sync verb backupbuddy-get-liveStats for retrieving local catalog/state statistics such as those shown on the BackupBuddy Stash Live page.
			Live update of stats when viewing the BackupBuddy Stash Live page.
	FEATURE:
		Stash (v2) destination now requests Stash Server to ping site whenever chunking commences to help push the cron along for inactive sites.
	FEATURE:
		Added single retry when attempting to schedule a one-time or recurring event in case there is a temporary problem.
	FEATURE:
		Only one BackupBuddy cron action may run per PHP page load. Subsequent actions will be rescheduled for the next load.
	FEATURE:
		If any maximum log file size is exceeded it is now trimmed down to 50% of its size (keeping most recent 50%) instead of completely deleting the log file.
	ENHANCEMENT:
		Adding remote destinations are now grouped by "Preferred", "Normal", and "Legacy" to make selecting destinstions easier.
	ENHANCEMENT:
		New option to limit the number of files returned in Amazon S3 (v2) destination. Defaults to 250 files per page.
	Resetting plugin settings to defaults no longer resets log_serial value.

	Remote send fileoptions cleanup now also removed lock file (if exists).
	Deployment no longer sends error emails for failed remote sends.

	S3 (v2) destination: Fixed inability to delete remote files due to extra slash in path.
	Stash (v) destination: Fixed long load times due to trying to load backup type from fileoptions. File listing no longer falls back to fileoptions for backup type.

	Added new {home_url} variable for error notification emails.
	Error emails now default to mentioning the {home_url} rather than {site_url} in emails.
	ImportBuddy: Now handles Live-formatting SQL filenames, prefixed with underscores. Imports underscore prefixed timestamped SQL files after normal SQL files, playing them back in the order they occurred.
	FEATURE:
		Automatic testing of the reported maximum PHP execution time.
			Improved reliability of traditional backups, remote destination sends, Deployments, and BackupBuddy Stash Live.
			Many servers report their maximum PHP execution time as a higher number than is actually available. This interferes with BackupBuddy's chunking during database backups, file transfers,
			and other operations which require a lot of time.  As of v7.0 BackupBuddy will actually test the available runtime and use the lesser value between the reported and tested numbers to
			ensure that chunking commences before time runs out, drastically reducing the chance of timeouts during any procedure where chunking is available and the server is misreporting runtime.
	Added additional logging when error is returned accessing remote API during deployment.
	Fixed AJAX URL compatibility issue with WPML plugin.
	New default log size of 3MB. Updated to new default if old value was either of the old defaults of 10mb or 5mb.

	ENHANCEMENT:
8.0.0.0 - 2017-06-13 - Dustin Bolton
	PROFILES
		New "Smart Profiles" Themes, Plugins, Media for backing up files of each respective type/location:
			SCREENSHOT: http://image.prntscr.com/image/c866aeb96c8d47dd86d44dbd66b3274b.png
			Use the new default smart profiles or create your own for further customizing. These new profile types allow you to automatically only backup this section of the site, allowing for more granular control over what is backed up by a profile. Paired with scheduling this allows you to easily break up backup processes into smaller portions for better spreading server load or timeout issues, especially for larger sites. Smart profiles also support directory and file exclusions.
		New "Custom backup root" option for all profile types (except database):
			SCREENSHOT: http://image.prntscr.com/image/af2c0f714183423eb8b04d4c146ad1e6.png
			You can now configure which directory BackupBuddy backs up on a per-profile basis. Prior to this feature you could only backup the entire site and select directories to exclude. You can now select any directory to be backed up, even directories ABOVE the WordPress root (abspath) by using "/../" in the path. This is useful for backing up individual directories, 3rd party applications, or directories outside the WordPress root. This can also be used for more granular control when breaking up backups across multiple profiles for spreading server load or working around timeout issues.
			Global exclusions apply but default but exclusions may be set for just this profile relative to this custom path manually or with the exclusion picker.
		"Full" and "Files" profiles now have three SMART exclusion options: Auto-exclude Media Directory, Auto-exclude Themes Directory, Auto-exclude Plugins Directory for making it easier to exclude directories which can be backed up by other default Profile types.
			SCREENSHOT: http://image.prntscr.com/image/5a2b85de30ad4ab281a362630fc038c6.png
		Backup profiles can now individually override the default global backup mode (classic vs modern) on a per-profile basis.
			SCREENSHOT: http://image.prntscr.com/image/b42fdd4ff549416fa9a25be28f1643e0.png
	STASH LIVE
		Significant performance improvements, especially for larger sites. Sites which in the past would run out of memory due to hosting limits are very likely to now operate within server limits.
		A troubleshooting scan is now regularly performed detecting common problems and alerting the user and also providing solutions.
		A new "Troubleshooting Scan" button to upper right of page of Stash Live page is available for manually troubleshooting.
			SCREENSHOT: http://image.prntscr.com/image/b80166b92ce24f77986b4892150ee325.png
	IMPORTBUDDY:
		New "Search Engine Visibility" setting to Step 6 of restore process, allowing you to either keep the setting as it was on the source site, turn on search engine visibility, or turn it off. Useful for moving sites between development, staging, and live locations.
			SCREENSHOT: http://image.prntscr.com/image/a10ff6ca440c4d6a8658eb3ed49c9e33.png
		Added "Forgot password" feature which allows you to generate a new password hash. This hash can then be placed inside the importbuddy.php file to make it usable even if you forgot its password.
			SCREENSHOT: http://image.prntscr.com/image/7786f5d6199040ea97eae3930526f226.png

			SCREENSHOT: http://image.prntscr.com/image/be93a67018f440f0910cee758152d8b8.png
		Javascript errors are now automatically detected and brought to the user's attention as well as logged to aid in troubleshooting. Sometimes various browser plugins running javascript fail causing importbuddy.php's javascript to halt.
		Improved look and feel with animated progress as well as highlights to areas that require user attention.
		importbuddy.php file size has been reduced for faster uploading during restore process.
	GENERAL
